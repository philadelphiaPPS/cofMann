<p style="text-align:center"> Our mission has always been to save the world from mediocre coffee.
Back in 1971 most people thought this was a noble yet hopelessly unachievable task.
But every cup of our Mocha Italia blend created since then has helped us in our quest.
Now we're the nation's favourite coffee shop, and yet another step closer to a world where bland, average coffee is consigned to history.

<p style="text-align:center">At CoffeeMan we control the whole coffee-making process from start to finish.
From the sourcing, right through to storing, blending, roasting, grinding and pouring, no-one else is involved.
Obsessive? Maybe, but we think the perfectly crafted end results are more than worth it. Our customers seem to agree. </p>
